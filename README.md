Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It ensures that software is scalable, efficient, reliable, and meets user needs.
Importance in the Technology Industry:
Ensures the development of high-quality software.
Helps manage complexity in large-scale systems.
Improves software maintainability and scalability.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering – This introduced the term "software engineering" and highlighted the software crisis, emphasizing structured development methodologies.
Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1970s-80s) – The rise of OOP (e.g., Smalltalk, C++) improved code reusability and modularity.
Agile Manifesto (2001) – This revolutionized software development by introducing Agile methodologies, emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and iterative development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning – Define project scope, goals, feasibility, and resources.
Requirement Analysis – Gather and document user and system requirements.
Design – Architect the software structure, UI/UX, and database models.
Implementation (Coding) – Developers write the actual program code.
Testing – Verify and validate functionality through unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
Deployment – Release the software for use in a production environment.
Maintenance & Updates – Fix bugs, optimize performance, and introduce new features

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall - Approach is	Linear & sequential, had to incorporate mid process
Agile - approach is Iterative & flexible, allows contious adjustments
Examples:
Waterfall: A government system requiring compliance with strict regulations.
Agile: A startup developing an evolving social media platform.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes and maintains code, designs algorithms, and implements functionality.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Tests software for bugs, ensures compliance with requirements, and maintains quality standards.
Project Manager – Oversees project progress, manages team coordination, ensures deadlines are met, and aligns work with business goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) – Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing in one platform. Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA.
Version Control Systems (VCS) – Track and manage code changes, enabling collaboration and rollback capabilities. Examples: Git, SVN.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual components or functions.
Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together.
System Testing – Verifies the entire system's functionality.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirements – Use Agile development for flexibility.
Debugging Complex Code – Utilize debugging tools and code reviews.
Tight Deadlines – Break tasks into manageable sprints (Agile approach).

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the practice of designing effective prompts to optimize AI model responses. It is important for improving AI interactions, ensuring accuracy, and refining outputs in AI applications like chatbots and automated systems.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
